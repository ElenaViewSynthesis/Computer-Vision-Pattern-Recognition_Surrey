function MinkoDis = compareMinkowskiDist()
% A generalization of both Euclidean and Manhattan distances, the Minkowski distance 
% is controlled by a parameter 'p.' When p=2, it's equivalent to the Euclidean distance, 
% and when p=1, it's equivalent to the Manhattan distance.

% Cosine Similarity: This metric measures the cosine of the angle between two non-zero vectors. 
% It's often used in text analysis and image retrieval when you want to measure the orientation rather than the magnitude of vectors.

% Hamming Distance: Primarily used for binary data like binary images or strings, it counts 
% the number of positions at which the corresponding elements of two vectors are different.

% Jaccard Similarity: Commonly used for sets or binary data, it measures the size of the intersection 
% of sets divided by the size of the union of sets. It's useful in applications like image retrieval and document analysis.

% Mahalanobis Distance: This metric takes into account the covariance structure of the data and is useful 
% when the data is not isotropic or when different features have different scales. It's often used in 
% object classification and clustering.

% Chebyshev Distance (Lâˆž Norm): It's the maximum absolute difference between any coordinate of two points. 
% This is a suitable metric when you want to measure dissimilarity based on the most significant difference between points.

% Correlation Distance: Measures the correlation between two vectors. It's used for finding similarities 
% between patterns when the absolute values are less important than the correlation structure.

% Dynamic Time Warping (DTW): A distance metric used for comparing time series data. It allows for the alignment of similar sequences with variations in time and amplitude.

% Bhattacharyya Distance: Commonly used in image processing and computer vision, it quantifies the statistical 
% similarity between two probability distributions, making it suitable for comparing histograms or pixel values in images.

% Earth Mover's Distance (EMD): Often used in image retrieval and object matching, it calculates the minimum 
% cost required to transform one distribution into another. It's particularly useful for comparing histograms.
